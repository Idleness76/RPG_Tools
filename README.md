# RPG_Tools

Simple .NET app for RPG tasks

## Problem:

Running RPG games can be tedious. Tools available online have an undesired cost. Develop simple tools to solve pain points in the game flow.

## Proposed Solution 1:

Create a simple app that will generate random townsfolk.

## Supporting Documentation:

- [REQUIREMENTS document](/doc/REQUIREMENTS.md) Holds a log of the requirements, both functional and technical for the project.
- [ARCHITECTURE document](/doc/ARCHITECTURE.md) Holds the design documentation for the project.
