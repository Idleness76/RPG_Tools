First, define a usable static design. Should include diagrams and descriptions of the different components that will for the overall solution.

Second, detailed design of individual components.

Third, cross referencing components; indentify their dependencies. This helps determines which components need to be built in relative priority.

## Detailed Designs

Likely do detailed design inside the application, then document here as progress happens.

## Dependency Assessment

Once the basic building blocks have been added to the application, then document who depends on what here.
